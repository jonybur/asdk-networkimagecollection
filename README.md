# asdk-networkimagecollection
A basic ASCollectionNode with a mosaic layout and ASCollectionNodes that lack intrinsic size built to experiment with [AsyncDisplayKit](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit).

ASRatioLayoutSpec with randomized ratios are used to give the ASNetworkImageNodes a pre-defined size.

This sample is based on the [CustomCollectionView](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/tree/master/examples) demo project and inspired by Happn's UI.
